<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I have been thinking of writing blogs for a long time (not very long, though, just for the past few months). I jumped around topics I wanted to write about, easy-to-understand artificial intelligence/data science blogs, movie reviews, or a girl’s life growing up. I began writing journals again recently (not so regularly, though) after several years of what I think was my first depressive episode. Soon, I thought, am I again going into another depressive episode, or am I already in it? Whatever the case, I started journaling to pen down my thoughts to become more introverted (I can’t explain why I associate journaling with being introverted). However, in a fix: do I want people to read what I write? or do I want to keep it to myself? Lastly, I wanted it to be perfect, make a webpage, add a blog section, and publish my blogs, but obviously, that is a lot of work, so it never happened.</p> <p>On 22nd October 2023, at 2:40 am, after watching the movie <strong>Wonder</strong>, I felt happy or, as I say, stimulated these days (I think I am a movie addict, a story for another time). Enough to wish the best for people around me and set me up in such a good mood that I want to write (maybe write for people to read).</p> <p>The story of Wonder revolves around Auggie the sun, but there are planets completely different from one another and affected by the sun differently. The movie’s main theme was perspective; a little perspective into others’ lives helps us be kinder to them. Yes, no one might have a harder life than Auggie, but he had more obvious support to compensate for the bad days. We see selfless goodwill for someone else does us good at the same time, by ourselves and others. Miranda gives the stage to Via. Jack and Summer become friends with Auggie. Via being there for her brother. Who better than children to teach us a bit of humility?</p> <p>What resonated with me the most was the first precept of the class by Mr Browne: “<em>If given a choice between being right or being kind, choose kind</em>” (I think I will get this tattooed someday). We instantly knew we had to be kind to Auggie. But I always try to find the cyclical meaning of the start and end of any movie. In the end, Auggie said (and I paraphrase it based on my perception), “<em>Everyone is fighting their demons; being kind is probably the best (or least) we can do</em>”. What started with us learning to be kind to a person we know is having a hard time ends with the fact that everyone around us deserves a little, if not equal, love, support, and kindness.</p> <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ocvLTJnYqodJ6BmDE_H5-g.jpeg"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/9marialopez" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@9marialopez</a></figcaption></figure> <p>I won’t ruin the movie for everyone any further. The cast, the storyline, the colours of the movie, and the written characters were good. The movie was a shallow overview of a significant part of Auggie’s life, given it was supposed to help us find depth in a glimpse (quite contrasting). Do give it a watch (maybe when you are low?) and drop in a comment.</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a51683dbb51b" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
