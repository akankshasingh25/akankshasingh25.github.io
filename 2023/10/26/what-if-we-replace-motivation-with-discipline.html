<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I have been in depression for a few years and then had anxiety for longer. I have been an overthinker for the longest, enough to induce anxiety attacks. But these days, I get weirded out if I am not thinking about life. I am a 24-year-old female, probably bicurious and polyamorous (in a happy, long-term, long-distance monogamous heterosexual relationship (did you see what I did there?)).</p> <p>At present, I think I have low days more than high, and I don't have anxiety anymore. I also think I have had or still have a personality disorder. I know we should leave the diagnosis to the professionals. Still, I know it is okay to self-diagnose, especially in a country like India, which stigmatises mental health and has normalised bigotry of many sorts. I consider myself financially well off and surrounded by a support system of liberal friends and family to afford paid therapy; still, I have never gone ahead with seeking a therapist.</p> <p>Why am I writing this blog right now? I have found my cure. I think, after all, what our boomers nagged us about turns out to be true and a solution for all our problems. Yes, getting up early in the morning will solve our problems, at least a few of them or all for me (hopefully, this "new thing" fixes me because I have bet all my sanity on it now, or I get a therapist for real this time (anyways it is a win-win, hehe)). Here, getting up early is an euphemism for leading a disciplined life. I have struggled to learn discipline during the depression and anxiety row of 8 years (please call me out if I am being tone-deaf; I will be thankful to you).</p> <p>Often, when I watch movies, I look for stimulation/inspiration, a way of motivation to get out of my bed, make me cry on my low days, start me thinking, and even get my life straight at times. But what I subconsciously am looking for is something to teach me how to be disciplined, only to realise discipline comes from taking action (though truth be told, I watch movies because I cannot read books or sing or draw or dance, whereas movies are an art form I am deeply fascinated by because it is just not one set of skill that is used in making a movie, maybe another blog on it).</p> <p>I have yearned to learn discipline, maybe acted on it once or twice, and had this epiphany more than ten times in my lifetime. If it were easy to learn discipline, it would have been ubiquitous. For most of us, following a simple daily routine is the toughest, often derailed by things of pertinence in the present. Falling short of the actualisation of a better future and a life.</p> <p>I have cried myself to sleep, locked myself in my room, isolated myself, and self-harmed in varying degrees instead of seeking whatever I knew would help me. I have chosen should over must, want over needs, and I have acted in the present without thoughts for the future. We all have made the choices, the same choices we would deem wrong in a sane and rational mind. I cannot explain human psychology or mental health problems, but all I have learnt all this while is we can help ourselves by taking small steps, one step at a time, and keep doing it. Discipline is consistency, perseverance, and monotonous. Discipline, in layperson's terms, is boring and tough. But discipline is rewarding at last, whenever that is if there is.</p> <p>Anyway, I have the luxury of thinking that only a few possess. I wish you find sanity in your ways.</p> <p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b5929b330f5d" width="1" height="1" alt=""></p> </body></html>
