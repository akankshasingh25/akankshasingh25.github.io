  I am a Post-Baccalaureate Fellow in CeRAI, IIT Madras, where I work under Prof. B. Ravindran. Previously, I conducted my Master's thesis research at IIT Jodhpur in the Image Analysis and Biometrics Lab (IAB), under Prof. Richa Singh and Prof. Mayank Vatsa. 
  
  Outside of work, I am an avid quizzer and a sportsperson. I love to watch movies and dramas. I am always on the lookout for vacation days to travel.
