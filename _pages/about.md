I am a researcher in Responsible AI, with a focus on deep learning for vision, speech, and natural language. Currently, I am a Post-Baccalaureate Fellow at the Centre for Responsible AI (CeRAI), IIT Madras, where I work with Prof. B. Ravindran. Previously, I conducted my Masterâ€™s thesis research at IIT Jodhpur in the Image Analysis and Biometrics Lab (IAB), under Prof. Richa Singh and Prof. Mayank Vatsa. Outside of academia, I am an avid quizzer and a sportsperson, with a passion for running and fitness.
